# mbus-to-udp
A converter that connects to a Kamstrup smart power meter MBUS output, reads OBIS data and sends them as UDP

## Short description

This is a complete converter - circuit, pcb, housing and a software. It is made to be used with node-red server. A sample node is also included.

## Language note

As the unit is designed for Norwegian power grid there is more detailed description in the norwegian language. I will translate if there will be interest for it.
